# Speech Emotion Recognition

This project implements a Speech Emotion Recognition system using deep learning. The system predicts emotions from audio files by extracting features such as MFCCs, chroma features, and more. 

## Features
- Audio preprocessing and feature extraction
- Data augmentation techniques (e.g., noise injection, pitch shifting)
- Deep learning model with Conv1D, Bidirectional LSTM
- Streamlit app for emotion recognition via an interactive UI
